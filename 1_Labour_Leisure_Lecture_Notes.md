The only truely universal human resource is time and we need to determine how to most effectively allocate that limited resources to maximize our happiness ("utility").

We general divide time across two groups or factors.
1. Work: Provides subsistence for life (consumption).
2. Leisure: None work time.

## What is Leisure?

- Free time?
- Non-work time?
- Non-market time?  

It can be hard to distinguish exactly where division between labour (work) and leisure occurs.

## Simple Model of Labour/Leisure Choice

We can think of labour and leisure as both "goods" that can be "purchased" with time. Both also provide utility:  
- Leisure directly: Happiness/joy/fulfillment.
- Labour indirectly: labour earns compensation (wage), which provides income that can be used to purchase consumption goods, which provide happiness.

### Basic Mathematical Model: $U(c,l)$

[Link one](https://github.blog/2022-05-19-math-support-in-markdown/), [link two](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/writing-mathematical-expressions) to using math in markdown documents.

$U = utility$  
$() = function$  
$c = consumption$  
$\ell = leisure$  

Hope to obtain maximum utility, but we are constrained by out limited resource, time:

Resource constaint (RC): $h = n + \ell$ where 
  
- $h = $ total avaliable time. (24? 16? ...)
- $n = $ labour time.  
- $\ell = $ leisure time.

Alternatively:

- $n = h - \ell$ or
- $\ell = h - n$

We can use labour time to acquire consumption:
- get/earn a wage, $w$ for ever unit of $n$.

> ### Aside:
> We generall think of this as a <ins>real wage</ins>.
> - Think of wage as opportunity cost of leisure (and vice versa).
> - can also include (directly or indirectly) the "price of leisure".

So $c = n\:*\:w$ or $\frac{c}{w}=n$
Plugging into RC:
> $n=h\:-\:\ell$  
> $\frac{c}{w}=h\:-\:\ell$  
> $c=w\left( h-\ell \right)$  

So consumption is determined by  

> 1. non-leisure time $\left( h-\ell \right)$
> 2. wage $\left( w \right)$  

Each hour of leisure provides utility: $U\uparrow\:as\:\ell\uparrow$  
But also takes away from $c \left( via\:n\downarrow \right): U\downarrow\:as\:c\downarrow$

## Question
How do people determine how to divide up time to maximize utility?  
> 1. Depends on ability to transform leisure time into consumption, at rate $w$.
> 2. But also depends on how much utility is dervied from leisure vs. consumption.
>> - same? $\left( 1\:to\:1 \right)$?  
>> - At all levels?

To understand the relationship, we use *Indifference Curves*
